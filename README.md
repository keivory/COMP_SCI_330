FINAL REPORT
App Name: WebAware
Problem and Motivation 

Our project tackles the issue of mental health among college students which has recently been a growing concern. Our project aims to help students maintain positive mental health, which includes helping them to realize their full potential, cope with stress and work productively. Numerous attempts have been made to approach the issue of mental health, ranging from the expansion of on-campus counseling services to mental health mobile applications. Counseling resources on campus are limited and students do not find them accessible enough. One prevalent app that tackles mental health is Talkspace which offers services ranging from individual counseling to coupleâ€™s therapy and the users can access licensed therapists. However, the aspect of accessing licensed therapists makes the app expensive. Other apps include Breathe2Relax and Tactical Breather which provide breathing exercises as a way of managing stress. While these apps are helpful for people suffering from anxiety, they are not tailored specifically for college students.
