# COMP_SCI_330 Final Report for Mental Health App WebAware# 

## Problem and Motivation ## 

Our project tackles the issue of mental health among college students which has recently been a growing concern. Our project aims to help students maintain positive mental health, which includes helping them to realize their full potential, cope with stress and work productively. Numerous attempts have been made to approach the issue of mental health, ranging from the expansion of on-campus counseling services to mental health mobile applications. Counseling resources on campus are limited and students do not find them accessible enough. One prevalent app that tackles mental health is Talkspace which offers services ranging from individual counseling to couple’s therapy and the users can access licensed therapists. However, the aspect of accessing licensed therapists makes the app expensive. Other apps include Breathe2Relax and Tactical Breather which provide breathing exercises as a way of managing stress. While these apps are helpful for people suffering from anxiety, they are not tailored specifically for college students. 


One of the ideas we built upon was journaling; journaling helps to control overwhelming emotions and improve mood by helping one prioritize fears and concerns. We would like to allow our users to express themselves through this tool. The other idea we will be implementing is the use of emojis to represent the user’s mood for the day. The series of these moods will be summarized in a line graph so that the user can analyze how their mood has been the entire week and month. Additionally, we will provide users with a calendar that will allow them to view their journal entries and their moods for each day. We want to give the user a chance to add events related to mental health in the calendar provided in the app. 


## High-Fidelity Prototyping (P5, P6, & P7) ##
Task #1: We implemented the task of checking a mental health reflection entry from a past date. In particular, if the user has a past entry on his emotional state (this is separate from the generic event input) then he can find an entry on that date, and if he clicks on it the mental health reflection (mood, reflections, journal tag, etc) will pop up.
